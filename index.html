                            <p class="card-text">The Ajanta Caves are 29 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments dating from
                                the second century BCE to about 480 CE in the Aurangabad District of Maharashtra state
                                in India. Ajanta Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Universally regarded as
                                masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, the caves include paintings and rock-cut
                                sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art,
                                particularly expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture, pose and form.

                                    The caves were built in two phases, the first starting around the second century BCE
                                    and
                                    the second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief
                                    period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.

                                    The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Chaityas) and worship-halls
                                    (Viharas)
                                    of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock. The
                                    caves
                                    also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha,
                                    pictorial
                                    tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.

                                    records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a
                                    resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India. While vivid colours and
                                    mural
                                    wall painting were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records,

                                    16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian

                            <p class="card-text">The Taj Mahal (Crown of the Palace) is an ivory-white marble
                                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It
                                was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to
                                house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah
                                Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
                                includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
                                sides by a crenellated wall.

                                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work
                                    continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal
                                    complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
                                    estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                                    approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project
                                    employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by
                                    Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism
                                    have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

                                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
                                    "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired
                                    masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best
                                    example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj
                                    Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared
                                    a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                                districts of the state of Assam, India. The park, which hosts two-thirds of the world's
                                Indian rhinoceroses, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the census held in
                                March 2018 which was jointly conducted by the Forest Department of the Government of
                                Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park
                                is 2,613. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males, 793 females, 206 unsexed); 387
                                sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed); and 385 calves.

                                    In 2015, the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga National Park was declared a
                                    Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants,
                                    wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird
                                    Area by BirdLife International for conservation of avifaunal species. When compared
                                    with other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in
                                    wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity
                                    hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.

                                    Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical
                                    moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the
                                    Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has
                                    been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its
                                    centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.

                                    in Goa in the World Heritage List are: 1) the influence of the monuments in the

                                    throughout Asia where Catholic missions were established; 2) the value of the set of

                            <p class="card-text">Pattadakal, also called Raktapura, is a complex of 7th and 8th century
                                CE Hindu and Jain temples in northern Karnataka (India). Located on the west bank of the
                                Malaprabha River in Bagalakote district, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is 14 miles (23
                                km) from Badami and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Aihole, both of which are historically
                                significant centres of Chalukya monuments. The monument is a protected site under Indian
                                law and is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

                                    UNESCO has described Pattadakal as "a harmonious blend of architectural forms from
                                    northern and southern India" and an illustration of "eclectic art" at its height.
                                    The Hindu temples are generally dedicated to Shiva, but elements of Vaishnavism and
                                    Shaktism theology and legends are also featured. The friezes in the Hindu temples
                                    display various Vedic and Puranic concepts, depict stories from the Ramayana, the
                                    Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, as well as elements of other Hindu texts, such as
                                    the Panchatantra and the Kirātārjunīya. The Jain temple is only dedicated to a
                                    single Jina. The most sophisticated temples, with complex friezes and a fusion of
                                    Northern and Southern styles, are found in the Papanatha and Virupaksha temples. The
                                    Virupaksha temple is an active house of Hindu worship.

                                    The river Mallaprabha, a tributary of Krishna river cutting across the valley of
                                    mountains surrounded and the plains has great importance and place in this history
                                    of south India. The origin of this river is from Kanakumbi, Belagavi district in the
                                    western ghats region flows towards the eastern side. Just 1 km before reaching
                                    pattadakkal it starts flowing from south to north. As per the Hindu tradition, a
                                    river that flows in the north direction is also called Uttaravahini

                            <p class="card-text">The Sundarbans National Park is a national park, tiger reserve and
                                biosphere reserve in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges
                                Delta and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. It is located to
                                south-west of the Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is
                                one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird,
                                reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present
                                Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban Tiger Reserve in 1973
                                and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park. It is a
                                UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987, and it has been designated as a Ramsar
                                site since 2019. It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and
                                Biosphere Reserve) from 1989.

                                    The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was
                                    established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as
                                    reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining
                                    portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the
                                    forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was
                                    placed under the control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the
                                    basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the
                                    headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the
                                    period 1893–1898.

                                    In 1911, it was described as a tract of unexamined waste country and was excluded
                                    from the census. It then stretched for about 266 kilometres (165 mi) from the mouth
                                    of the Hugli to the mouth of the Meghna river and was bordered inland by the three
                                    settled districts of the 24 parganas, Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area
                                    (including water) was estimated at 16,900 square kilometres (6,526 sq mi). It was a
                                    water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at
                                    reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans was everywhere intersected
                                    by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout
                                    the Bengal region both for steamers and for native ships. The maximum part of the
                                    delta is located in Bangladesh.
